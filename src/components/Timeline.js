      <TimelineCard activity="Mid-Fidelity Prototype & Discussed with our medical director (decision-maker)" details="Unfortunately, I didn't meet with the medical director, the key decision-maker, until I had a more finalized version of the prototype (mid-fidelity stage). He was very busy, and my manager felt that it was unnecessary to bother him with an extra meeting in the early stages. At the time, I wasn't aware of the importance of getting user feedback early on. This led to a challenging meeting where several design aspects weren't his top priority. I addressed this by iterating on the design and holding further meetings with him."/>
      <TimelineCard activity="Cross-Departmental Stakeholder Meeting" details="While meeting a few users from different departments for design feedback, I discovered some conflicts in needs between users and even the medical director. For example, a user loved the original design for a feature that had been changed based on the medical director's input.
      I needed to gather wider user feedback. Thatâ€™s where I met with the representatives from over 80 departments, which of course, was chaos."/>
      <TimelineCard activity="Optimized Mid-Fidelity Prototype based on new feedback" details="The meeting marked a turning point. While revisions to the mid-fidelity prototype required extra effort, they were necessary."/>
      <TimelineCard activity="Lack of Comprehensive Testing" details="Back then, I wore both designer and developer hats, and testing wasn't a big priority in my head. I was under a lot of pressure and always working against deadlines, so I jumped right into development without much testing beforehand."/>
      <TimelineCard activity="Developed" details="I was the only front-end developer on the team, working with two back-end developers and a database engineer."/>
      <TimelineCard activity="Project on hold" details="I was surprised to hear the project might be put on hold and outsourced. I knew I wanted to fix the situation. Here are the key points I used to convince the director to keep it going in-house:<br><ul><li>Highlighting the total cost, including the time and effort already invested in the project, compared to outsourcing from scratch.</li><li>Emphasizing our team's deep understanding of the company and its systems, which would lead to a faster and smoother development process with fewer problems.</li></ul>"/>
      <TimelineCard activity="Rapid deployment without testing" details="Convincing the director to keep the project in-house was a big win, but it came with a challenge: he wanted to see the final product right away." notlast="false" />
